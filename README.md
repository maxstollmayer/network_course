# Course in Network Science - online material

This repo contains jupyter notebooks and datasets to support 
the course 
### 'Introduction to complex network analysis'

## Howto run Jupyter Notebooks

Our tutorials use Python 3 and NetworkX (2.4 or later).  

If you don't want to rely on the interactive Colab notebooks you can run Python locally on your computer by installing Jupyter/IPython on your machine, we recommend installing the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) Python distribution with Python 3. 
Required pyhton modules can be loaded using `pip` or `conda`. 

Make a folder on your machine and clone this repo into it by cd into your folder and running the following command in your terminal

> git clone git@github.com:menchelab/network_course.git

(alternative option: > git clone https://github.com/menchelab/network_course.git)

and update on a weekly basis with

There will be changes in the main branch by us on a regular basis. Make sure that you have the latest version of the current notebooks by downloading them to your local machine:

> git pull origin main
  
Save your own modified notebooks as `Lastname_Matrikelnr_LectureNr.ipynb`.

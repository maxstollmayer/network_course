    "Since NetworkX 2, the `.degree()` method on a directed graph gives the total degree: in-degree plus out-degree. However, in a bit of confusing nomenclature, the `neighbors` method is a synonym for `successors`, giving only the edges originating from the given node. This makes sense if you consider `neighbors` to be all the nodes reachable from the given node by following links, but it's easy to make the mistake of writing `.neighbors()` in your code when you really want both predecessors and successors."
